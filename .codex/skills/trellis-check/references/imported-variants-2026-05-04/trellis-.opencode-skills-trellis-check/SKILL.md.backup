Check if the code you just wrote follows the development guidelines.

Execute these steps:

1. **Identify changed files**:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only HEAD
   ```

2. **Determine which spec modules apply** based on the changed file paths:
   ```bash
   python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
   ```

3. **Read the spec index** for each relevant module:
   ```bash
   cat .trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md
   ```
   Follow the **"Quality Check"** section in the index.

4. **Review your code** against each relevant guideline listed in the index.

5. **Run lint and typecheck** for the affected package.

6. **Report any violations** and fix them if found.
