# Academic Writing Knowledge Base

This knowledge base contains reusable academic writing knowledge mined from papers.

## Canonical maintained memory

The canonical paper-miner memory is:

- `paper-miner-writing-memory.md`

This is the **only maintained paper-miner writing memory**.

It stores:
- writing patterns mined,
- structure signals,
- reusable phrasing,
- venue-specific signals,
- how those signals help future writing,
- and a source index.

## Maintenance rule

`paper-miner` always writes mined writing knowledge into `paper-miner-writing-memory.md`.

This memory is:
- **global**,
- **cross-project**,
- **not project-specific**.

If `paper-miner` is invoked inside a project, it may use project context to understand relevance, but it still writes only to the global memory.

## Legacy files

Older files such as:
- `structure.md`
- `writing-techniques.md`
- `submission-guides.md`
- `review-response.md`

may still exist as historical material, but new paper-miner updates should treat `paper-miner-writing-memory.md` as the canonical maintained memory.

## Usage

Use this knowledge base when:
- drafting papers,
- improving section structure,
- borrowing reusable phrasing patterns,
- preparing rebuttals,
- studying venue-facing writing signals.

## Contributing

When `paper-miner` analyzes a new paper:
1. extract actionable writing knowledge,
2. merge it into `paper-miner-writing-memory.md`,
3. preserve source attribution,
4. avoid duplicate patterns,
5. keep the memory compact and reusable.
