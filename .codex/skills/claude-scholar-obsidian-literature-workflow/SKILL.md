# Obsidian Literature Workflow

This skill owns the **project literature workflow**.

## Main flow

```text
Sources/Papers/ -> Knowledge/ -> Writing/ -> Maps/literature.canvas
```

## Default outputs

- `Sources/Papers/{paper-slug}.md`
- `Knowledge/Literature Overview.md`
- `Knowledge/Method Taxonomy.md`
- `Knowledge/Research Gaps.md`
- `Knowledge/Claim Map.md`
- `Writing/related-work-draft.md`
- `Writing/comparison-matrix.md`
- `Maps/literature.canvas`

## Rules

- paper notes stay under `Sources/Papers/`
- literature synthesis does not live inside source notes
- every synthesis note must link its supporting source notes
- every research gap must carry evidence
- default graph output is `Maps/literature.canvas`
- do not generate extra canvases unless explicitly requested
