# Review Response

A systematic review response workflow that helps researchers efficiently and professionally reply to reviewer comments.

## Core Features

1. **Review Analysis** - Parse and classify reviewer comments (Major/Minor/Typo/Misunderstanding)
2. **Response Strategy** - Develop response strategies for different comment types (Accept/Defend/Clarify/Experiment)
3. **Rebuttal Writing** - Write structured, professional rebuttal documents
4. **Tone Management** - Optimize tone to maintain professionalism, respect, and evidence-based arguments

## Workflow

```
Receive reviewer comments -> Parse and classify -> Develop strategy -> Write responses -> Tone check -> Final rebuttal
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- "Help me write a rebuttal"
- "How to respond to reviewer comments"
- "Analyze these review comments"
- "Develop a review response strategy"

## Usage Steps

1. **Provide reviewer comments** - Share the reviewer comments text or file with Claude
2. **Analysis and classification** - Claude automatically parses and classifies the comments
3. **Strategy recommendations** - Receive response strategy suggestions for each comment
4. **Write rebuttal** - Generate a structured rebuttal document based on the strategy
5. **Optimize tone** - Review and optimize the professionalism and politeness of responses

## Core Principles

- **Professionalism** - Maintain an academically professional tone and expression
- **Respectfulness** - Respect the reviewers' opinions and time
- **Evidence-based** - Support every response with sufficient reasoning and evidence
- **Completeness** - Ensure all reviewer comments receive a response

## Success Factors (Based on ICLR Spotlight Paper Analysis)

Key lessons extracted from successful rebuttal cases:

### 1. Acknowledge Strengths, Respond Positively to Criticism
- Reviewers will first acknowledge the paper's strengths (novelty, impact, practical applicability)
- Even spotlight papers receive constructive criticism
- **Strategy**: Thank reviewers for acknowledged strengths first, then address criticism specifically

### 2. Provide Clarity and Intuitive Understanding
- Even high-quality papers may have clarity issues
- Need to provide intuition and detailed explanations for readers with different backgrounds
- **Strategy**: Expand key sections, move technical details to appendix, add step-by-step walkthroughs

### 3. Thorough Justification of Experimental Setup
- Need to justify experimental setup choices
- Consider and discuss alternative metrics
- Provide comprehensive experiments to support claims
- **Strategy**: Add ablation studies, explain why specific experimental setups were chosen

### 4. Emphasis on Ethical Considerations
- For research involving privacy, security, and other sensitive topics, ethical considerations are crucial
- Reviewers pay special attention to ethical implications
- **Strategy**: Proactively discuss ethical considerations, even if reviewers don't explicitly request it

### 5. Highlight Practical Application Value
- Reviewers value practical applicability and scalability of methods
- "Easily applicable" and "scalable" are important strengths
- **Strategy**: Emphasize practical benefits and scalability in the rebuttal

## Integration with paper-miner global writing memory

When the rebuttal task involves:
- tone calibration,
- rebuttal phrasing,
- clarification language,
- structuring multi-point responses,
- or learning from strong prior paper/review writing,

read this file before drafting:

- project-local paper-writing memory when present, for example
  `.codex/skills/ai-research-20-ml-paper-writing-ml-paper-writing/references/knowledge/paper-miner-writing-memory.md`

### Default read order for rebuttal work

1. reviewer comments and paper context
2. `paper-miner-writing-memory.md`
3. `references/response-strategies.md`
4. `references/rebuttal-templates.md`
5. `references/tone-guidelines.md`

Read narrowly:
- start with `How this helps our writing`,
- then inspect `Reusable phrasing`,
- then inspect `Venue-specific signals` if the rebuttal is venue-sensitive,
- use `Writing patterns mined` only when the response needs stronger rhetorical structure.

Do not quote the memory mechanically. Use it to improve structure, clarity, restraint, and professionalism.
