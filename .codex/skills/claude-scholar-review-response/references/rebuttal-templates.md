# Response to Reviewers

We sincerely thank all reviewers for their valuable feedback and constructive suggestions. We have carefully addressed all comments and made substantial revisions to improve the manuscript. Below, we provide detailed responses to each reviewer's comments.

---

## Response to Reviewer 1

We thank Reviewer 1 for the thorough review and insightful comments.

### Major Comments

**Comment 1.1**: The paper lacks comparison with recent state-of-the-art method X. This comparison is essential for evaluating the proposed method.

**Response**: We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have conducted additional experiments comparing our method with X on all three datasets. The results show that our method achieves comparable or better performance (Dataset A: +2.3%, Dataset B: +1.1%, Dataset C: -0.5%).

**Changes**: These new results have been added to Table 3 (page 7) and discussed in Section 4.3 (pages 7-8). We also provide detailed analysis of the performance differences.

---

**Comment 1.2**: The authors should provide more details about the training procedure, including hyperparameters and convergence criteria.

**Response**: We appreciate this comment and agree that more implementation details would be helpful. We have added a comprehensive description of our training procedure.

**Changes**: We have added Section 3.4 "Training Details" (page 5) which includes:
- Complete hyperparameter settings (Table 2)
- Convergence criteria and early stopping strategy
- Training time and computational resources
- Code availability statement


---

### Minor Comments

**Comment 1.3**: There are several typos in Section 2. For example, "recieve" should be "receive" on page 3.

**Response**: We thank the reviewer for catching these errors. We have carefully proofread the entire manuscript and corrected all typos.

**Changes**: All typos have been corrected throughout the manuscript.

---

**Comment 1.4**: Figure 2 is difficult to read. The font size should be increased.

**Response**: We appreciate this feedback. We have improved the figure quality.

**Changes**: Figure 2 has been redesigned with larger fonts and clearer labels (page 6).

---

**Comment 1.5**: The related work section should discuss paper Y, which is highly relevant.

**Response**: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have expanded the related work section to include discussion of paper Y.

**Changes**: We have added a paragraph discussing paper Y in Section 2.2 (page 3) and included it in the comparison table (Table 1).

---

We hope our responses and revisions have adequately addressed all of your concerns. We are grateful for your valuable feedback.


---

## Response to Reviewer 2

We thank Reviewer 2 for the constructive feedback.

### Major Comments

**Comment 2.1**: The authors claim that their method is more efficient than baseline methods, but no runtime analysis is provided. Please add computational complexity analysis and runtime comparisons.

**Response**: We appreciate this important comment. We have added comprehensive efficiency analysis.

**Changes**: We have added Section 4.4 "Efficiency Analysis" (page 8) which includes:
- Theoretical computational complexity analysis (O-notation)
- Runtime comparison with baseline methods (Table 4)
- Memory consumption analysis (Figure 4)
- Discussion of efficiency-performance trade-offs

The results show that our method achieves 3.2x speedup compared to the previous state-of-the-art while maintaining comparable accuracy.

---

### Minor Comments

**Comment 2.2**: The notation in Equation 3 is inconsistent with the rest of the paper.

**Response**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have standardized the notation throughout the manuscript.

**Changes**: Equation 3 (page 4) has been revised to use consistent notation. We have also added a notation table in the appendix for clarity.

---

**Comment 2.3**: The discussion of limitations is too brief.

**Response**: We agree that a more thorough discussion of limitations would strengthen the paper.

**Changes**: We have expanded Section 5.3 "Limitations and Future Work" (page 10) to include:
- Detailed discussion of current limitations
- Potential failure cases
- Directions for future research

---

We believe the revisions we have made in response to your comments have substantially strengthened the manuscript. Thank you for your thorough review.

## Response to Reviewer 3

We thank Reviewer 3 for the careful review and helpful suggestions.

### Minor Comments

**Comment 3.1**: The abstract should be more concise and focus on the key contributions.

**Response**: We appreciate this feedback. We have revised the abstract to be more focused and concise.

**Changes**: The abstract has been rewritten (page 1) to highlight the three key contributions and remove unnecessary details.

---

**Comment 3.2**: Some figures are not referenced in the text.

**Response**: We thank the reviewer for catching this. We have ensured all figures are properly referenced.

**Changes**: We have added references to Figure 5 in Section 4.2 (page 7) and Figure 6 in Section 4.5 (page 9).

---

**Comment 3.3**: The conclusion should discuss broader impact and societal implications.

**Response**: We agree that discussing broader impact is important.

**Changes**: We have added Section 6 "Broader Impact" (page 11) discussing potential societal implications, ethical considerations, and responsible use of our method.

---

We are grateful for your valuable feedback, which has helped us improve the manuscript significantly.
