# Context Mode Purge

Permanently deletes ALL session data for this project: knowledge base, session events, analytics, and stats.

## Instructions

1. **Warn the user**: This is irreversible. Everything will be deleted:
   - FTS5 knowledge base (all indexed content from `ctx_index`, `ctx_fetch_and_index`, `ctx_batch_execute`)
   - Session events DB (analytics, metadata, resume snapshots)
   - Session events markdown file
   - In-memory session stats
2. Call the `mcp__context-mode__ctx_purge` MCP tool with `confirm: true`.
3. Report the result to the user — the response lists exactly what was deleted.

## When to Use

- When the KB contains stale or incorrect content polluting search results.
- When switching between unrelated projects in the same session.
- When you want a completely fresh start for this project.

## Important

- `ctx_purge` is the **only** way to delete session data. No other mechanism exists.
- `ctx_stats` is read-only — shows statistics only.
- `/clear` and `/compact` do NOT affect any context-mode data.
- There is no undo. Re-index content if you need it again.
