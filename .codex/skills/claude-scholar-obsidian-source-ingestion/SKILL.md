# Obsidian Source Ingestion

Use this skill when external material should become a project-local source note.

## Targets

- `Sources/Papers/`
- `Sources/Web/`
- `Sources/Docs/`
- `Sources/Data/`
- `Sources/Interviews/`
- `Sources/Notes/`

## Core rules

- source notes are source-centered, not synthesis-centered
- every new canonical source note must update `_system/registry.md`
- important sources should update `02-Index.md`
- if the source arrived during an active work session, append a short note to today's `Daily/`
- do not create a top-level `Papers/`
