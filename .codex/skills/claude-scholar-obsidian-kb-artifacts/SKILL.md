# Obsidian KB Artifacts

This skill handles format and artifact concerns only.

## Responsibilities

- Obsidian Markdown formatting
- wikilinks and embeds
- registry table formatting
- canvas generation and validation
- optional Bases generation
- Obsidian CLI operations
- link repair in canonical notes
- lint-report formatting

## Rules

- this skill does not decide where knowledge belongs
- `.base` is explicit-only
- `Maps/` contains derived artifacts only
- link repair should strengthen existing canonical notes, not create note sprawl
