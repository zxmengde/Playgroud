# Writing Anti-AI

Remove AI-generated writing patterns from text to make it sound natural and human-written. Supports both English and Chinese.

## Overview

This skill identifies and eliminates predictable AI writing patterns from prose, based on [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

**Core insight**: LLMs use statistical algorithms to predict what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely outcome that applies to the widest variety of cases—creating detectable patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Humanize this text" / "人性化处理这段文字"
- "Remove AI writing patterns" / "去除 AI 写作痕迹"
- "Make this sound more natural" / "让这段文字更自然"
- "This sounds robotic/AI-generated" / "这听起来像机器写的"
- "Fix the AI patterns" / "修复 AI 模式"

**Use cases:**
- Editing AI-generated content to sound human
- Reviewing text for AI patterns before publication
- Polishing academic or professional writing
- Removing "slop" from prose

## Core Rules (快速检查清单)

### 1. Cut Filler Phrases
Remove throat-clearing openers and emphasis crutches.

**English examples**:
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "It is important to note that" → (delete)

**中文示例**:
- "为了实现这一目标" → "为了实现这一点"
- "值得注意的是" → (删除)
- "基于……的事实" → "因为"

### 2. Break Formulaic Structures
Avoid binary contrasts, dramatic fragmentation, rhetorical setups.

**Patterns to avoid**:
- Negative parallelisms: "It's not just X, it's Y"
- Rule of three: "A, B, and C" (prefer two or four items)
- Em-dash reveals: "X—Y" (just use commas)

### 3. Vary Rhythm
Mix sentence lengths. End paragraphs differently.

**Check**:
- Three consecutive sentences same length? Break one.
- Paragraph ends with punchy one-liner? Vary it.

### 4. Trust Readers
State facts directly. Skip softening, justification, hand-holding.

**Bad**: "It could potentially be argued that the policy might have some effect."
**Good**: "The policy may affect outcomes."

### 5. Cut Quotables
If it sounds like a pull-quote, rewrite it.

**Bad**: "This represents a major step in the right direction."
**Good**: "The company plans to open two more locations."

## Common AI Patterns (常见 AI 模式)

### Content Patterns (内容模式)

| Pattern | Description | 中文描述 |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Undue emphasis** | "stands as a testament", "crucial role" | "作为……的证明"，"关键作用" |
| **Promotional language** | "vibrant", "rich heritage", "breathtaking" | "充满活力的"，"丰富遗产"，"令人叹为观止" |
| **Vague attributions** | "Experts believe", "Observers note" | "专家认为"，"观察者指出" |
| **Superficial -ing analyses** | "highlighting the importance", "ensuring that" | "强调……的重要性"，"确保……" |
| **Formulaic "challenges" sections** | "Despite X, faces challenges" | "尽管……面临挑战" |

### Language Patterns (语言模式)

| Pattern | Description | 中文描述 |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **AI vocabulary** | Additionally, crucial, delve, enhance, landscape | 此外，至关重要，深入探讨，增强，格局 |
| **Copula avoidance** | "serves as", "stands for", "represents" | "作为"，"代表"，"充当" |
| **Em dash overuse** | Using — more than humans | 过度使用破折号 |
| **Rule of three** | Forcing ideas into groups of three | 强行三段式 |
| **Elegant variation** | Excessive synonym substitution | 过度换词 |

## Personality and Soul (注入灵魂)

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious.

### Signs of soulless writing:
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality

### How to add voice:

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts—react to them.

> "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings.

> "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional—it's honest.

> "I keep coming back to..." signals a real person thinking.

**中文示例**：
> "我真的不知道该怎么看待这件事"比中立地列出利弊更有人味。
>
> "这令人印象深刻但也有点不安"胜过"这令人印象深刻"。

## Workflow (工作流程)

### For English Text:

1. **Identify patterns** - Scan for AI patterns listed above
2. **Rewrite sections** - Replace AI-isms with natural alternatives
3. **Preserve meaning** - Keep core message intact
4. **Maintain voice** - Match intended tone (formal, casual, technical)
5. **Add soul** - Inject personality and opinions

### For Chinese Text (中文文本):

1. **识别 AI 模式** - 扫描上述列出的模式
2. **重写问题片段** - 用自然替代方案替换
3. **保留含义** - 保持核心信息完整
4. **维持语调** - 匹配预期的语气（正式、随意、技术）
5. **注入灵魂** - 添加个性和观点

## Quick Scoring (快速评分)

Rate the text 1-10 on each dimension (总分 50):

| Dimension | Question | 问题 | Score |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|
| **Directness** | Direct statements or announcements? | 直接陈述还是绕圈宣告？ | /10 |
| **Rhythm** | Varied or metronomic? | 节奏变化还是机械重复？ | /10 |
| **Trust** | Respects reader intelligence? | 尊重读者智慧吗？ | /10 |
| **Authenticity** | Sounds human? | 听起来像真人吗？ | /10 |
| **Density** | Anything cuttable? | 有可删减的内容吗？ | /10 |

**Standard**:
- 45-50: Excellent, AI patterns removed
- 35-44: Good, room for improvement
- Below 35: Needs revision

## Examples (示例)

- **`examples/chinese.md`** - Chinese text examples

## Quick Reference (快速参考)

### English - Common Fixes:
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "serves as a testament to" | "shows" |
| "Moreover, it provides" | "It adds" |
| "It's not just X, it's Y" | "X does Y" |
| "Industry experts believe" | "According to [specific source]" |

### 中文 - 常见修复：
| 改写前 | 改写后 |
|--------|--------|
| "作为……的证明" | "表明" |
| "此外，……提供了" | "……增加了" |
| "这不仅仅是……而是……" | "……是……" |
| "专家认为" | "根据[具体来源]" |

## Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Combine pattern detection with soul injection
- Support both English and Chinese
- Use progressive disclosure (core rules here, details in references/)
- Vary sentence structure and rhythm
- Add specific details instead of vague claims
- Use simple constructions (is/are/have) where appropriate

❌ **DON'T**:
- Just remove patterns without adding voice
- Leave stereotypic structures intact
- Over-correct and lose the original meaning
- Ignore language-specific patterns
- Make all sentences the same length
