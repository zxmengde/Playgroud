# Research Ideation

Supports the complete workflow for the research project initiation phase, from literature review to research question definition, method selection, and research planning.

## Core Features

### 1. Idea Brainstorming (5W1H Framework)

Systematically brainstorm research ideas using the 5W1H framework:
- **What**: What problem or phenomenon to study
- **Why**: Why this problem is important
- **Who**: Target audience and stakeholders
- **When**: Time scope and context of the research
- **Where**: Application scenarios and domains
- **How**: Preliminary research methodology ideas

**Integration with superpowers:brainstorming**: Can invoke the superpowers:brainstorming skill for interactive brainstorming to help rapidly generate and evaluate research ideas.

### 2. Literature Review

Systematically search, analyze, and synthesize related literature:
- Build effective search keywords
- Search via WebSearch across academic databases (arXiv, Google Scholar, etc.)
- Screen and evaluate paper quality
- Identify research trends and gaps
- Generate structured literature reviews
- **Zotero Integration**: Papers are automatically added to Zotero via DOI, organized into topic-based collections, and open-access PDFs are auto-attached for full-text reading

### 3. Gap Analysis

Systematically identify and evaluate research gaps:
- **Literature gaps**: Identify topics or questions not yet sufficiently studied
- **Methodological gaps**: Discover limitations and improvement opportunities in existing methods
- **Application gaps**: Identify opportunities for theory-to-practice transfer
- **Interdisciplinary gaps**: Discover research opportunities at the intersection of different fields
- **Temporal gaps**: Identify new research needs arising from changes over time

**Analysis Dimensions:**
- Coverage of research topics
- Comparison of strengths and weaknesses of existing methods
- Completeness of experimental setups
- Availability of datasets and benchmarks
- Gap between theory and practice

### 4. Research Question Definition

Formulate specific research questions based on literature analysis:
- Identify research gaps and opportunities
- Apply SMART principles to formulate questions
- Evaluate importance, novelty, and feasibility
- Define research objectives and expected contributions

### 5. Method Selection

Select appropriate research methods:
- Analyze strengths and weaknesses of existing methods
- Evaluate method applicability
- Identify required technologies and resources
- Consider method feasibility

### 6. Research Planning

Develop detailed research plans:
- Plan research timeline
- Define milestones and deliverables
- Identify potential risks
- Assess resource requirements

## When to Use

### Scenarios for This Skill

Use the research-ideation skill in the following situations:

1. **Starting a new research project** - Have research interests but no clear research question yet
2. **Literature review** - Need to systematically understand a research field
3. **Research question formulation** - Need to transform vague ideas into specific research questions
4. **Method selection** - Need to choose appropriate research methods and technical approaches
5. **Research planning** - Need to plan research timeline and resources

### Typical Workflow

```
Research interest → Idea brainstorming (5W1H) → Literature review → Gap analysis → Define question → Select method → Create plan
```

**Output Files:**
- `literature-review.md` - Structured literature review
- `research-proposal.md` - Research proposal (including question, method, plan)
- `references.bib` - References in BibTeX format
- Zotero collection with organized papers and PDFs

## Integration with Other Systems

### Complete Research Workflow

```
research-ideation (Research initiation)
    ↓
Experiment execution (completed by user)
    ↓
results-analysis (Results analysis)
    ↓
ml-paper-writing (Paper writing)
```

### Data Flow

- **research-ideation output** → Guides experiment design and method selection
- **Experimental results** → results-analysis for statistical analysis
- **Analysis results** → Related Work and Methods sections of ml-paper-writing

### Zotero Integration

Through the Zotero MCP server, the research-ideation workflow automates literature management:

- **Paper Discovery**: WebSearch finds relevant papers across academic databases
- **Auto-Import**: Extract DOI / arXiv ID / landing-page URLs from search results, then use `zotero_add_items_by_identifier` to prefer paper/preprint imports before any webpage fallback
- **Collection Organization**: `zotero_create_collection` creates topic-based collections with standard sub-collections (Core Papers, Methods, Applications, Baselines, To-Read)
- **PDF Attachment**: `zotero_add_items_by_identifier(..., attach_pdf=true)` runs a PDF cascade (landing-page PDF hints → direct PDF → Unpaywall), and `zotero_find_and_attach_pdfs` can be used as a follow-up sweep for remaining items
- **Full-Text Reading**: `zotero_get_item_fulltext` reads indexed PDF content for analysis and note-taking
- **Library Search**: `zotero_search_items` and `zotero_get_collection_items` browse existing papers to avoid duplicates

### Key Configuration

- **Literature search scope**: Papers from the last 3 years by default, configurable
- **Output format**: Markdown format for easy editing and version control
- **Citation management**: Generates references in BibTeX format
- **Zotero collection naming**: `Research-{topic}-{YYYY}` format
- **PDF auto-attach**: Enabled by default for open-access papers via Unpaywall
