### Abstract (150–250 words, 5 sentences)

```text
Sentence 1: Problem context and importance
Sentence 2: Gap in existing approaches
Sentence 3: Key insight or thesis ("X is better for Y in environment Z")
Sentence 4: Summary of approach and key results
Sentence 5: Broader impact or availability
```

**Source**: Levin & Redell — "Can you state the new idea concisely? Use them in the abstract." Irene Zhang — "The abstract is harder to write because you cannot use terms or concepts you introduced in the paper."

### S1 Introduction (1.5–2 pages)

**Paragraph structure**:

1. **Problem statement** (~0.5 page) — Establish the domain and why it matters. Use concrete numbers (cluster sizes, workload statistics, latency requirements).
2. **Gap analysis** (~0.5 page) — Enumerate specific gaps G1–Gn in existing systems. Each gap is one sentence with evidence.
3. **Key insight** (1 paragraph) — The thesis statement: "X is better for applications Y running in environment Z." (Irene Zhang formula)
4. **Contributions** (~0.5 page) — Numbered list of 3–5 concrete contributions. Each contribution is testable and maps to a section.

**Writing pattern**: hzwer Move 1 (Establish territory) → Move 2 (Find niche) → Move 3 (Occupy niche).

**Source**: Irene Zhang — "clearly state your target environment (Z) and application (Y)" + "clearly state why previous systems do not meet the needs"; Levin & Redell — "What exactly is the problem being solved?"

### S2 Background & Motivation (1–1.5 pages)

**Paragraph structure**:

1. **Technical background** (~0.5 page) — Define terms and systems the reader needs. Follow Gernot Heiser's "define-before-use" principle.
2. **Production observations** (~0.5–1 page) — Present Observation 1, 2, 3 from real data or measurements. Each observation leads to a design insight.

**Source**: Irene Zhang — "clearly motivate Y and Z. Why is application Y important?"; Gernot Heiser — "define-before-use."

### S3 Design (3–4 pages)

**Paragraph structure**:

1. **System architecture overview** (~0.5 page) — Architecture diagram first (Yi Ding: "draw a picture first"). One-paragraph walkthrough of major components and data flow.
2. **Module-by-module design** (~2–2.5 pages) — Each subsection: what the module does, the design choice made, alternatives considered, and why this choice wins.
3. **Design alternatives and trade-offs** (~0.5–1 page) — For each major decision, explicitly discuss what was not chosen and why.

**Source**: Irene Zhang — "Every design choice made in X should be discussed with alternatives and the reasons for the choice"; Levin & Redell — "What were the alternatives considered at various points, and why were the choices made?"

### S4 Implementation (0.5–1 page)

1. **Prototype description** — Language, framework, LOC, integration with existing systems.
2. **Key engineering decisions** — Non-obvious implementation choices worth documenting.

**Source**: Levin & Redell — "Does the paper describe something that has actually been implemented?"; Irene Zhang — "explain how you constructed a prototype to test your hypothesis."

### S5 Evaluation (3–4 pages)

**Paragraph structure**:

1. **Experimental setup** (~0.5 page) — Hardware, baselines, workloads, metrics. Enough detail to reproduce.
2. **End-to-end comparison** (~1–1.5 pages) — X vs baselines for application Y on environment Z. Main performance results.
3. **Microbenchmarks / Ablation** (~1–1.5 pages) — Isolate each design decision's contribution. Ablation experiments decompose the gains.
4. **Scalability** (~0.5 page) — Show behavior as problem size, cluster size, or load increases.

**Critical rule** (Irene Zhang): State every experimental conclusion **three times**:
- Section opening: hypothesis ("We expect X to outperform Y because...")
- Section closing: conclusion ("Results show X outperforms Y by Z%")
- Figure caption: evidence ("Figure N shows X achieves Z% better throughput than Y")

**Two experiment types**:
- Type 1: X vs baselines for Y on Z (end-to-end comparison)
- Type 2: Ablation — remove each design component to measure its individual impact

### S6 Related Work (1 page)

- Group by **methodology or approach**, not by individual papers.
- For each group: what they do, what limitation remains, how your work differs.
- Use a comparison table when comparing 4+ systems on specific dimensions.

**Source**: Levin & Redell — "Are comparisons with previous work clear and explicit?"; Irene Zhang — use comparison tables.

### S7 Conclusion (0.5 page)

Three sentences (Irene Zhang formula):
1. The hypothesis / problem addressed
2. The solution approach
3. The key result

## Writing Patterns

Four reusable patterns for structuring systems papers. See [references/writing-patterns.md](references/writing-patterns.md) for detailed examples.

### Pattern 1: Gap Analysis (Lucid, ASPLOS'23)
Enumerate gaps G1–Gn in Introduction → map to answers A1–An in Design. Creates a clear contract with the reader.

### Pattern 2: Observation-Driven (GFS, arXiv 2025)
Present production observations (O1–O3) in Motivation → derive design insights → build system around insights. Effective when you have real workload data.

### Pattern 3: Contribution List (Blox, EuroSys'24; Sia, SOSP'23)
Numbered contributions in Introduction, each mapping to a section. Readers (and reviewers) can track claims through the paper.

### Pattern 4: Thesis Formula (Irene Zhang)
Structure the entire paper around: "X is better for applications Y running in environment Z." Introduction states it, Design explains how, Evaluation proves it.

## Writing Philosophy

### Manage Reader State (Gernot Heiser)
Treat the reader's cognitive load like an OS managing process state. Never introduce a concept without context. Never reference something defined later without a forward pointer.

### Six-Dimensional Quality (Levin & Redell)
Self-check against: **Original Ideas**, **Reality** (is it built?), **Lessons** (what did you learn?), **Choices** (alternatives discussed?), **Context** (related work fair?), **Presentation** (clear writing?).

### Page-One Figure (hzwer)
Include a figure on the first page that captures the core idea. Reviewers form first impressions from the title, abstract, and page-one figure.

---

## Academic Integrity Requirements

### Citation Discipline
- **Never generate citations from memory.** Use ml-paper-writing's citation verification workflow (Semantic Scholar / DBLP / CrossRef APIs).
- Mark unverified references as `[CITATION NEEDED]`.

### Prohibition of Fabrication
- Do NOT fabricate production observations, traces, deployment experiences, or experimental results.
- Do NOT generate fake venue rules, paper metadata, or best-paper claims.
- Do NOT copy paragraph-level text from reference papers. This blueprint provides **structural guidance**, not copy-paste templates.

### LLM Disclosure
- Some venues require disclosure of substantial LLM use in writing or ideation. Check each venue's AI policy in the current CFP.

### Attribution
- When structures are inspired by specific papers (e.g., Lucid's gap-analysis pattern), cite the inspiration.
- Cross-repository references (e.g., ARIS paper-slides structure) are attributed, not copied.

### Temporal Validity
- Venue rules (page limits, format, AI policies) change annually. All venue information in this skill is based on 2025/2026 CFPs. **Always verify against the current year's CFP.**

## Workflow: Structuring a New Systems Paper

```text
Step 1: Read this SKILL.md for page allocation overview
Step 2: Read references/section-blueprints.md for per-section paragraph templates
Step 3: Choose a writing pattern from references/writing-patterns.md
Step 4: Draft section by section following the blueprint
Step 5: Run the checklist from references/checklist.md before submission
Step 6: Use ml-paper-writing for citation verification and LaTeX formatting
```

### Quick Checklist

- [ ] Thesis statement follows "X is better for Y in Z" formula
- [ ] Introduction has numbered contributions (3–5)
- [ ] Each contribution maps to a paper section
- [ ] Design discusses alternatives for every major choice
- [ ] Every eval conclusion stated 3 times (hypothesis, result, caption)
- [ ] Related work grouped by methodology, not individual papers
- [ ] Page budget within venue limits
- [ ] All citations verified programmatically (no hallucinated references)

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Paper feels like a "feature list" | Restructure around thesis formula: X better for Y in Z |
| Evaluation lacks depth | Add ablation experiments isolating each design decision |
| Reviewers say "incremental" | Strengthen gap analysis: make G1–Gn crisper with evidence |
| Design section too long | Move implementation details to S4, keep S3 at design level |
| Motivation feels weak | Add production observations with concrete numbers |
| Related work reads like a bibliography | Group by approach, add explicit differentiation |
