# Finish Work

Wrap up the current session: archive the active task (and any other completed-but-unarchived tasks the user wants to clean up) and record the session journal. Code commits are NOT done here — those happen in workflow Phase 3.4 before you invoke this skill.

## Step 1: Survey current state

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode record
```

This prints:

- **My active tasks** — review whether any besides the current one are actually done (code merged, AC met) and should be archived this round.
- **Git status** — quick visual on what's dirty.
- **Recent commits** — you'll need their hashes in Step 4 for `--commit`.

If `--mode record` surfaces other completed tasks not tied to the current session, surface them to the user with a one-shot confirmation: "These N tasks look done — archive them too in this round? [y/N]". Default is no; the current active task is always archived in Step 3 regardless.

## Step 2: Sanity check — working tree must be clean

Run:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Filter out paths under `.trellis/workspace/` and `.trellis/tasks/` — those are managed by `add_session.py` and `task.py archive` auto-commits and will appear dirty as part of this skill's own work.

If anything else is dirty (any path outside those two prefixes), **stop and bail out** with:

> "Working tree has uncommitted code changes. Return to workflow Phase 3.4 to commit them before running `$finish-work`."

Do NOT run `git commit` here. Do NOT prompt the user to commit. The user goes back to Phase 3.4 and the AI drives the batched commit there.

## Step 3: Archive task(s)

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <task-name>
```

At minimum: the current active task (if any). Plus any extra tasks the user confirmed in Step 1. Each archive produces a `chore(task): archive ...` commit via the script's auto-commit.

If there is no active task and the user did not confirm any cleanup archives, skip this step.

## Step 4: Record session journal

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py \
  --title "Session Title" \
  --commit "hash1,hash2" \
  --summary "Brief summary"
```

Use the work-commit hashes produced in Phase 3.4 (visible in Step 1's `Recent commits` list, or via `git log --oneline`) for `--commit`. Do not include the archive commit hashes from Step 3. This produces a `chore: record journal` commit.

Final git log order: `<work commits from 3.4>` → `chore(task): archive ...` (one or more) → `chore: record journal`.

## Relationship to Other Skills

```
Development Flow:
  Phase 3.4 (workflow.md) -> AI drafts batched commits -> user confirms -> git commit
                                                                              |
                                                                              v
                                                                    $finish-work
                                                                    (survey + archive + journal)

Debug Flow:
  Hit bug -> Fix -> $break-loop -> Knowledge capture
```

- `$finish-work` — this skill, survey + archive + record session
- `$break-loop` — deep analysis after debugging

## Consolidated Trellis Skill Merge

Replaces the platform-specific `trellis-finish-work` duplicate.

### Retained Rules
- Survey current state before ending: active tasks, git status, recent commits, and completed-but-unarchived tasks.
- Stop if working tree has uncommitted code outside Trellis-managed task/workspace paths; commits belong to the implementation workflow, not finish-work itself.
- Archive current and user-confirmed completed tasks using Trellis task tooling.
- Record a session journal tied to actual work commits, excluding archive/journal commits from the work summary.
