# First Principles Thinking

A systematic approach to decomposing complex problems into irreducible truths and reasoning upward from there — avoiding the trap of reasoning by analogy, convention, or "best practice".

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether an architecture, design, or strategy is truly optimal
- Questioning "best practices" that may not fit the current context
- Breaking through when conventional solutions feel inadequate
- Making foundational decisions with long-term impact
- Challenging inherited assumptions in legacy systems or legacy thinking
- Any moment where "we've always done it this way" is the primary justification

## When NOT to Use

- Trivial decisions (use Occam's Razor instead — just pick the simplest)
- Time-critical emergencies (act first, analyze later)
- Well-validated problems with proven solutions (don't reinvent the wheel)
- When you lack domain expertise AND can't acquire it (first principles without knowledge = naive solutions)

## Core Methodology: 6 Phases

### Phase 0: Frame the Question — Establish Axioms

Before analyzing anything, define the irreducible truths that constrain this domain.

**Axioms** = facts that are independently verifiable, cannot be further decomposed, and violating them definitely causes failure.

**How to identify axioms:**
- Ask: "Can this be further decomposed?" — If yes, it's not an axiom yet.
- Ask: "Is this provably true, not just commonly believed?" — If uncertain, it's an assumption.
- Ask: "Would violating this definitely cause failure?" — If maybe, it's a preference.

**Gate**: Must produce ≥3 axioms before proceeding. Each axiom stated in one sentence with a "why irreducible" justification.

```markdown
### Axioms
1. [Axiom] — [Why this cannot be further decomposed]
2. [Axiom] — [Why this is provably true]
3. [Axiom] — [Why violating this causes failure]
```

> Deep methodology: `references/axiom-based-reasoning.md`

### Phase 1: Identify the Problem's Essence

Strip away implementation details to find the core problem.

1. **State the problem clearly** — What exactly needs to be solved?
2. **Separate symptoms from causes** — Is this the real problem or a manifestation?
3. **Define success criteria** — What would a perfect solution achieve? (Measurable.)

**Key questions:**
- What is the fundamental job to be done here?
- If this system/process didn't exist, what would we actually need?
- What outcome matters, independent of how we get there?

**Gate**: Must produce a one-sentence problem statement + measurable success criteria.

### Phase 2: Surface and Challenge All Assumptions

This is the highest-leverage phase. Most "best practices" are assumptions disguised as facts.

1. **List explicit assumptions** — What are we taking as given?
2. **Surface implicit assumptions** — What conventions are we following without questioning?
3. **Test each against axioms** — Is this actually a constraint (traces to axiom), or just how it's always been done?

**Minimum**: Produce an assumption table with ≥5 rows.

| Assumption | Why Question It | Axiom(s) Used | Verdict |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| "We need X" | [Challenge] | A1, A2 | Keep / Discard / Modify |

**Red flags (likely false assumptions):**
- "We've always done it this way"
- "Industry standard says..."
- "Everyone uses X for this"
- "That's too simple to work"

**Depth standard**: Each row must include *why* you're questioning it and *which axiom* informs the verdict. "Maybe not needed" without reasoning = not deep enough.

**Gate**: ≥5 assumptions challenged with verdicts. Each verdict must reference at least one axiom.

> Deep methodology: `references/axiom-based-reasoning.md` § "Identify and Challenge Assumptions"

### Phase 3: Establish Ground Truths

From the wreckage of challenged assumptions, identify what IS irreducibly true for this specific problem.

**Ground Truth test:**
- Can this be further decomposed? → If yes, decompose it.
- Is this provably true, not just commonly believed? → If unsure, it's still an assumption.
- Would violating this definitely cause failure? → If not, it's a preference.

**Gate**: Must produce ≥3 ground truths. Each must be specific and falsifiable — not generic truisms.

```
❌ "Users need fast response times" (too vague)
✅ "P99 latency must be < 200ms per SLA contract §3.2" (specific, verifiable)

❌ "The team is small" (relative)
✅ "Team is 3 engineers, no new hires possible before Q3" (concrete constraint)
```

### Phase 4: Reason Upward

Build solutions from ground truths only. Each layer must justify its existence.

```
Ground Truth → Minimal Solution → Justified Additions → Final Design
     ↑              ↑                    ↑
  (proven)     (sufficient)        (each defended)
```

1. **Start minimal** — What's the simplest thing that satisfies all ground truths?
2. **Add only what's necessary** — Each addition must reference a ground truth or axiom.
3. **Challenge each layer** — Does this layer earn its complexity?

**Gate**: Must produce a reasoning chain where every step traces to a ground truth.

```markdown
### Reasoning Chain
GT#1 (latency < 200ms) + GT#3 (3-person team) → Eliminate distributed architecture
GT#2 (read-heavy 95%) + GT#1 → Add read cache with 30s TTL
→ Conclusion: Monolith + in-memory cache
```

### Phase 5: Validate and Stress-Test

Ensure the reasoning is sound before acting.

**Three validation questions (Completion Gate):**

| # | Question | What Failure Means |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | Can every conclusion trace back to a ground truth? (**Traceability**) | You've introduced unjustified assumptions in Phase 4 |
| 2 | Is every ground truth covered by at least one conclusion? (**Completeness**) | Your solution ignores a constraint — it will fail there |
| 3 | Were any phases skipped or done shallowly? (**Honesty**) | Go back and finish them |

**Stress-test with complementary models:**

| Model | Question to Ask | When It Adds Value |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Pre-Mortem** | "It's 12 months later and this failed. Why?" | When you're excited about the solution |
| **Second-Order** | "If this works, what happens next? And after that?" | When solution has systemic effects |
| **Inversion** | "What would guarantee failure? Are we doing any of that?" | When you need to find blind spots |
| **OODA Act** | "What's the smallest test we can run right now?" | When analysis paralysis sets in |

> Full model toolkit: `references/thinking-models-toolkit.md`

**Gate**: All 3 validation questions answered "yes". At least one stress-test model applied.

## Reasoning Discipline Protocol

**Problem**: AI tends to skip steps, get distracted mid-analysis, or do each step shallowly.

### Phase Gates (Mandatory Artifacts)

| Phase | Must Produce | Min Depth |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 0: Frame | ≥3 axioms with justifications | Each axiom: 1 sentence + why irreducible |
| 1: Essence | Problem statement + success criteria | Specific and measurable |
| 2: Assumptions | Assumption table ≥5 rows | Each row: challenge + axiom reference + verdict |
| 3: Ground Truths | ≥3 ground truths | Each: specific, falsifiable, not a truism |
| 4: Reason Up | Reasoning chain with GT references | Every step traces to a GT |
| 5: Validate | 3 validation answers + 1 stress test | All answers = "yes" |

**No artifact → no next phase.** If a gate is not met, stop and complete it.

### Progress Tracker (Anti-Drift)

Maintain a running checklist throughout the analysis. After each phase completion, output:

```markdown
## 🧭 FP Progress
- [x] Phase 0: Frame — ✅ 3 axioms
- [x] Phase 1: Essence — ✅ "..."
- [→] Phase 2: Assumptions — 3/6 checked
- [ ] Phase 3: Ground Truths
- [ ] Phase 4: Reason Upward
- [ ] Phase 5: Validate
```

**If conversation drifts** (user asks a tangent, discussion expands on a side topic), after addressing it, immediately output:

> 📍 Returning to FP analysis: Phase N has M items remaining. Continuing.

### Depth Standards (Anti-Shallow)

| Phase | Shallow (Fail) | Deep (Pass) |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Assumptions | "Maybe we don't need this" | Table row with challenge reason + axiom reference + verdict |
| Ground Truths | "Users want fast" | "P99 < 200ms per SLA §3.2" |
| Reasoning | "So we should use X" | "GT#2 + GT#3 → eliminates Y → X is minimal solution" |

## Trellis Integration

When used within a Trellis-managed project, the analysis artifacts integrate with the task system.

### File Placement

```
.trellis/tasks/{MM-DD-slug}/
├── task.json              # Existing
├── prd.md                 # Existing — FP feeds into this
├── fp-analysis.md         # ← FP analysis output (Phases 0-5)
├── fp-progress.md         # ← Phase progress tracker (anti-drift)
├── implement.jsonl        # Existing — fp-analysis.md auto-added
├── check.jsonl            # Existing — fp-analysis.md auto-added
└── ...
```

### Brainstorm Integration

During `/trellis:brainstorm`, when the task is classified as "Complex":

1. **Trigger**: User says "从第一性原理分析" or AI detects the problem has ≥3 unvalidated assumptions
2. **Execute**: Run Phases 0-3, saving output to `fp-analysis.md` in task directory
3. **Feed into PRD**:
   - Ground Truths → PRD Requirements and Constraints
   - Assumption Table → PRD Technical Notes / Trade-offs
   - Reasoning Chain → PRD Technical Design or `info.md`
4. **Continue**: Phases 4-5 inform implementation decisions

### Context Injection

After FP analysis completes, add to context files:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" implement "fp-analysis.md" "Ground truths and reasoning chain"
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" check "fp-analysis.md" "Verify implementation traces to ground truths"
```

### Completion Recording

After Phase 5, update `task.json`:

```json
{
  "fp_analysis": {
    "completed": true,
    "axioms_count": 3,
    "assumptions_challenged": 6,
    "ground_truths_count": 5,
    "validation_passed": true
  }
}
```

```

## Common Traps

### The Complexity Trap
**Symptom**: Solution is more complex than the problem warrants.
**FP Check**: Remove one component — does it still solve the core problem? If yes, that component wasn't essential. Repeat.

### The Analogy Trap
**Symptom**: "Company X does it this way, so we should too."
**FP Check**: What problem was Company X solving? Is ours identical in all relevant dimensions? What constraints differ?

### The Legacy Trap
**Symptom**: Maintaining compatibility with decisions that no longer serve us.
**FP Check**: What was the original reason? Do those conditions still exist? What's the true cost of change vs. cost of maintaining?

## Bias Awareness

The 5 most dangerous biases for first-principles analysis:

| Bias | How It Corrupts FP | Quick Debias |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Confirmation** | You "find" ground truths that confirm your preferred solution | Seek disconfirming evidence first |
| **Anchoring** | Conventional approach becomes mental anchor even when thinking "fresh" | Generate 3 alternatives before evaluating |
| **Sunk Cost** | Legacy decisions feel like ground truths | "If starting from zero today, would we choose this?" |
| **Status Quo** | "How it works now" feels like a constraint when it's a choice | Separate true constraints from current choices |
| **Overconfidence** | Treat assumptions as ground truths without testing | Assign confidence % to each assumption |

## Problem Decomposition

Before applying FP to a complex problem, you may need to decompose it first. Quick selection:

| Problem Type | Best Framework |
|-------------|---------------|
| Diagnostic (why is X happening?) | Issue Tree or Fishbone |
| Financial (revenue/cost) | Profitability Tree |
| Strategic (what should we do?) | Hypothesis Tree |
| Operational (what's broken?) | Process Flow + 5 Whys |
| Complex adaptive system | Systems Map |

## Consolidated Trellis Skill Merge

Replaces the platform-specific `first-principles-thinking` duplicates.

### Retained Rules
- Use only when the task requires challenging assumptions or reasoning from fundamentals, not for trivial/time-critical choices.
- Establish at least three axioms with why each is irreducible or independently verifiable.
- Separate problem essence from symptoms, define measurable success criteria, then list and test assumptions against axioms.
- Build conclusions upward from ground truths and ensure every conclusion traces back to one.
- Stress-test with pre-mortem, second-order effects, inversion, or the smallest feasible test before recommending action.
