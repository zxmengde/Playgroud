## What async checkpointing changes
- Moves checkpointing off the critical training path via `torch.distributed.checkpoint.async_save`
- Introduces extra memory overhead because async save first copies model state into internal CPU buffers

## Practical agent guidance
- Use async save when checkpoint stalls are significant and you have headroom for CPU memory.
- Consider pinned memory strategies described in the recipe if performance matters.
