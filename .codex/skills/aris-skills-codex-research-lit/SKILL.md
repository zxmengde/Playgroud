# Research Literature Review

Research topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Constants

- **PAPER_LIBRARY** — Local directory containing user's paper collection (PDFs). Check these paths in order:
  1. `papers/` in the current project directory
  2. `literature/` in the current project directory
  3. Custom path specified by user in `AGENTS.md` under `## Paper Library`
- **MAX_LOCAL_PAPERS = 20** — Maximum number of local PDFs to scan (read first 3 pages each). If more are found, prioritize by filename relevance to the topic.
- **ARXIV_DOWNLOAD = false** — When `true`, download top 3-5 most relevant arXiv PDFs to PAPER_LIBRARY after search. When `false` (default), only fetch metadata (title, abstract, authors) via arXiv API — no files are downloaded.
- **ARXIV_MAX_DOWNLOAD = 5** — Maximum number of PDFs to download when `ARXIV_DOWNLOAD = true`.
- **REVIEWER_BACKEND = `codex`** — Default reviewer route for optional literature synthesis cross-checks. Use `--reviewer: oracle-pro` only when explicitly requested; if Oracle is unavailable, warn and continue with Codex xhigh or local synthesis.

> 💡 Overrides:
> - `/research-lit "topic" — paper library: ~/my_papers/` — custom local PDF path
> - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: zotero, local` — only search Zotero + local PDFs
> - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: zotero` — only search Zotero
> - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: web` — only search the web (skip all local)
> - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: web, semantic-scholar` — also search Semantic Scholar for published venue papers
> - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: deepxiv` — only search via DeepXiv progressive retrieval
> - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: all, deepxiv` — use default sources plus DeepXiv
> - `/research-lit "topic" — arxiv download: true` — download top relevant arXiv PDFs
> - `/research-lit "topic" — arxiv download: true, max download: 10` — download up to 10 PDFs

## Data Sources

This skill checks multiple sources **in priority order**.

### Source Selection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for a `— sources:` directive:
- **If `— sources:` is specified**: Only search the listed sources (comma-separated). Valid values: `zotero`, `obsidian`, `local`, `web`, `semantic-scholar`, `deepxiv`, `exa`, `all`.
- **If not specified**: Default to `all` — search every available source in priority order (`semantic-scholar`, `deepxiv`, and `exa` are excluded from `all`; they must be explicitly listed).

Examples:
```
/research-lit "diffusion models"                        → all (default)
/research-lit "diffusion models" — sources: all         → all
/research-lit "diffusion models" — sources: zotero      → Zotero only
/research-lit "diffusion models" — sources: zotero, web → Zotero + web
/research-lit "diffusion models" — sources: local       → local PDFs only
/research-lit "topic" — sources: obsidian, local, web   → skip Zotero
/research-lit "topic" — sources: web, semantic-scholar  → web + Semantic Scholar API
/research-lit "topic" — sources: deepxiv                → DeepXiv only
/research-lit "topic" — sources: all, deepxiv           → default sources + DeepXiv
/research-lit "topic" — sources: all, semantic-scholar  → default sources + Semantic Scholar API
/research-lit "topic" — sources: exa                    → Exa only (broad web + content extraction)
/research-lit "topic" — sources: all, exa               → default sources + Exa web search
```

### Source Table

| Priority | Source | ID | How to detect | What it provides |
|----------|--------|----|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Zotero** (via MCP) | `zotero` | Try calling any `mcp__zotero__*` tool — if unavailable, skip | Collections, tags, annotations, PDF highlights, BibTeX, semantic search |
| 2 | **Obsidian** (via MCP) | `obsidian` | Try calling any `mcp__obsidian-vault__*` tool — if unavailable, skip | Research notes, paper summaries, tagged references, wikilinks |
| 3 | **Local PDFs** | `local` | `Glob: papers/**/*.pdf, literature/**/*.pdf` | Raw PDF content (first 3 pages) |
| 4 | **Web search** | `web` | Always available (WebSearch) | arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar |
| 5 | **Semantic Scholar API** | `semantic-scholar` | ARIS `tools/semantic_scholar_fetch.py` helper | Published venue papers (IEEE, ACM, Springer) with structured metadata: citation counts, venue info, TLDR. **Only runs when explicitly requested** |
| 6 | **DeepXiv CLI** | `deepxiv` | ARIS `tools/deepxiv_fetch.py` helper or installed `deepxiv` CLI | Progressive paper retrieval: search, brief, head, section, trending, web search. **Only runs when explicitly requested** |
| 7 | **Exa Search** | `exa` | ARIS `tools/exa_search.py` helper or installed `exa-py` SDK | AI-powered broad web search with content extraction (highlights, text, summaries). Covers blogs, docs, news, companies, and research papers beyond arXiv/S2. **Only runs when explicitly requested** |

> If the user explicitly requests Zotero or Obsidian and that source is not configured, stop and tell the user how to enable it. Only sources that were not requested may be skipped silently.

## Workflow

### Step 0a: Search Zotero Library (if available)

**If the user explicitly requested Zotero and the Zotero MCP is not configured, stop and ask the user to configure it. Otherwise skip this step entirely.**

Try calling a Zotero MCP tool (e.g., search). If it succeeds:

1. **Search by topic**: Use the Zotero search tool to find papers matching the research topic
2. **Read collections**: Check if the user has a relevant collection/folder for this topic
3. **Extract annotations**: For highly relevant papers, pull PDF highlights and notes — these represent what the user found important
4. **Export BibTeX**: Get citation data for relevant papers (useful for `/paper-write` later)
5. **Compile results**: For each relevant Zotero entry, extract:
   - Title, authors, year, venue
   - User's annotations/highlights (if any)
   - Tags the user assigned
   - Which collection it belongs to

> 📚 Zotero annotations are gold — they show what the user personally highlighted as important, which is far more valuable than generic summaries.

### Step 0b: Search Obsidian Vault (if available)

**If the user explicitly requested Obsidian and the Obsidian MCP is not configured, stop and ask the user to configure it. Otherwise skip this step entirely.**

Try calling an Obsidian MCP tool (e.g., search). If it succeeds:

1. **Search vault**: Search for notes related to the research topic
2. **Check tags**: Look for notes tagged with relevant topics (e.g., `#diffusion-models`, `#paper-review`)
3. **Read research notes**: For relevant notes, extract the user's own summaries and insights
4. **Follow links**: If notes link to other relevant notes (wikilinks), follow them for additional context
5. **Compile results**: For each relevant note:
   - Note title and path
   - User's summary/insights
   - Links to other notes (research graph)
   - Any frontmatter metadata (paper URL, status, rating)

> 📝 Obsidian notes represent the user's **processed understanding** — more valuable than raw paper content for understanding their perspective.

### Step 0c: Scan Local Paper Library

Before searching online, check if the user already has relevant papers locally:

1. **Locate library**: Check PAPER_LIBRARY paths for PDF files
   ```
   Glob: papers/**/*.pdf, literature/**/*.pdf
   ```

2. **De-duplicate against Zotero**: If Step 0a found papers, skip any local PDFs already covered by Zotero results (match by filename or title).

3. **Filter by relevance**: Match filenames and first-page content against the research topic. Skip clearly unrelated papers.

4. **Summarize relevant papers**: For each relevant local PDF (up to MAX_LOCAL_PAPERS):
   - Read first 3 pages (title, abstract, intro)
   - Extract: title, authors, year, core contribution, relevance to topic
   - Flag papers that are directly related vs tangentially related

5. **Build local knowledge base**: Compile summaries into a "papers you already have" section. This becomes the starting point — external search fills the gaps.

> 📚 If no local papers are found, skip to Step 1. If the user has a comprehensive local collection, the external search can be more targeted (focus on what's missing).

### Step 1: Search (external)
- Use WebSearch to find recent papers on the topic
- Check arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar
- Focus on papers from last 2 years unless studying foundational work
- **De-duplicate**: Skip papers already found in Zotero, Obsidian, or local library

**arXiv API search** (always runs, no download by default):

Locate the fetch script and search arXiv directly:
```bash
ARIS_REPO="${ARIS_REPO:-$(awk -F'\t' '$1=="repo_root"{print $2; exit}' .aris/installed-skills-codex.txt 2>/dev/null)}"
SCRIPT=""
[ -n "$ARIS_REPO" ] && [ -f "$ARIS_REPO/tools/arxiv_fetch.py" ] && SCRIPT="$ARIS_REPO/tools/arxiv_fetch.py"
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && SCRIPT=$(find tools/ -name "arxiv_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && SCRIPT=$(find ~/.codex/skills/arxiv/ -name "arxiv_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Search arXiv API for structured results (title, abstract, authors, categories)
[ -n "$SCRIPT" ] && python3 "$SCRIPT" search "QUERY" --max 10
```

If `arxiv_fetch.py` is not found, fall back to WebSearch for arXiv (same as before).

The arXiv API returns structured metadata (title, abstract, full author list, categories, dates) — richer than WebSearch snippets. Merge these results with WebSearch findings and de-duplicate.

**Semantic Scholar API search** (only when `semantic-scholar` is in sources):

When the user explicitly requests `— sources: semantic-scholar` or `— sources: web, semantic-scholar`, search for published venue papers beyond arXiv:

```bash
S2_SCRIPT=""
[ -n "$ARIS_REPO" ] && [ -f "$ARIS_REPO/tools/semantic_scholar_fetch.py" ] && S2_SCRIPT="$ARIS_REPO/tools/semantic_scholar_fetch.py"
[ -z "$S2_SCRIPT" ] && S2_SCRIPT=$(find tools/ -name "semantic_scholar_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$S2_SCRIPT" ] && S2_SCRIPT=$(find ~/.codex/skills/semantic-scholar/ -name "semantic_scholar_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -n "$S2_SCRIPT" ]; then
    python3 "$S2_SCRIPT" search "QUERY" --max 10 --fields title,authors,year,venue,citationCount,externalIds,tldr,url
else
    echo "Semantic Scholar unavailable: no semantic_scholar_fetch.py helper; skipping this optional source." >&2
fi
```

Why use Semantic Scholar? Many IEEE/ACM journal papers are not on arXiv. S2 fills the gap for published venue-only papers with citation counts and venue metadata.

De-duplication between arXiv and S2:
- Match by arXiv ID first (`externalIds.ArXiv`), then normalized title.
- If a paper appears in both and S2 has venue / DOI / citation metadata, use S2 as authoritative metadata while keeping the arXiv PDF link.
- S2 results without `externalIds.ArXiv` are venue-only papers and should be preserved as unique value.

**DeepXiv search** (only when `deepxiv` is in sources):

When the user explicitly requests `— sources: deepxiv` (or includes `deepxiv` in a combined source list), use the DeepXiv adapter for progressive retrieval:

```bash
DEEPXIV_SCRIPT=""
[ -n "$ARIS_REPO" ] && [ -f "$ARIS_REPO/tools/deepxiv_fetch.py" ] && DEEPXIV_SCRIPT="$ARIS_REPO/tools/deepxiv_fetch.py"
[ -z "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" ] && DEEPXIV_SCRIPT=$(find tools/ -name "deepxiv_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" ] && DEEPXIV_SCRIPT=$(find ~/.codex/skills/deepxiv/ -name "deepxiv_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -n "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" ]; then
    python3 "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" search "QUERY" --max 10
    python3 "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" paper-brief ARXIV_ID
    python3 "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" paper-head ARXIV_ID
    python3 "$DEEPXIV_SCRIPT" paper-section ARXIV_ID "Experiments"
elif command -v deepxiv >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    deepxiv search "QUERY" --limit 10 --format json
    deepxiv paper ARXIV_ID --brief --format json
    deepxiv paper ARXIV_ID --head --format json
    deepxiv paper ARXIV_ID --section "Experiments" --format json
else
    echo "DeepXiv unavailable: no deepxiv_fetch.py adapter and no deepxiv CLI; skipping this optional source." >&2
fi
```

If `deepxiv_fetch.py` or the `deepxiv` CLI is unavailable, skip this source gracefully and continue with the remaining requested sources.

**De-duplication against other sources**:
- Match by arXiv ID first
- Fall back to normalized title when needed
- Keep one canonical paper entry and record `deepxiv` as an additional source when it overlaps with web/arXiv findings

**Exa search** (only when `exa` is in sources):

When the user explicitly requests `— sources: exa` (or includes `exa` in a combined source list), use the Exa tool for broad AI-powered web search with content extraction:

```bash
EXA_SCRIPT=""
[ -n "$ARIS_REPO" ] && [ -f "$ARIS_REPO/tools/exa_search.py" ] && EXA_SCRIPT="$ARIS_REPO/tools/exa_search.py"
[ -z "$EXA_SCRIPT" ] && EXA_SCRIPT=$(find tools/ -name "exa_search.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$EXA_SCRIPT" ] && EXA_SCRIPT=$(find ~/.codex/skills/exa-search/ -name "exa_search.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Search for research papers with highlights
[ -n "$EXA_SCRIPT" ] && python3 "$EXA_SCRIPT" search "QUERY" --max 10 --category "research paper" --content highlights

# Search for broader web content (blogs, docs, news)
[ -n "$EXA_SCRIPT" ] && python3 "$EXA_SCRIPT" search "QUERY" --max 10 --content highlights
[ -n "$EXA_SCRIPT" ] || echo "Exa unavailable: no exa_search.py helper; skipping this optional source." >&2
```

If `exa_search.py` or the `exa-py` SDK is unavailable, skip this source gracefully and continue with the remaining requested sources.

**De-duplication against other sources**:
- Match by URL first, then normalized title
- If Exa returns an arXiv paper already found by other sources, prefer structured metadata from arXiv/S2
- Exa results from non-academic domains (blogs, docs, news) are unique value not covered by other sources

**Optional PDF download** (only when `ARXIV_DOWNLOAD = true`):

After all sources are searched and papers are ranked by relevance:
```bash
# Download top N most relevant arXiv papers
[ -n "$SCRIPT" ] && python3 "$SCRIPT" download ARXIV_ID --dir papers/
```
- Only download papers ranked in the top ARXIV_MAX_DOWNLOAD by relevance
- Skip papers already in the local library
- 1-second delay between downloads (rate limiting)
- Verify each PDF > 10 KB

### Step 2: Analyze Each Paper
For each relevant paper (from all sources), extract:
- **Problem**: What gap does it address?
- **Method**: Core technical contribution (1-2 sentences)
- **Results**: Key numbers/claims
- **Relevance**: How does it relate to our work?
- **Source**: Where we found it (Zotero/Obsidian/local/web) — helps user know what they already have vs what's new

### Step 3: Synthesize
- Group papers by approach/theme
- Identify consensus vs disagreements in the field
- Find gaps that our work could fill
- If Obsidian notes exist, incorporate the user's own insights into the synthesis

### Step 4: Output
Present as a structured literature table:

```
| Paper | Venue | Method | Key Result | Relevance to Us | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|--------|
```

Plus a narrative summary of the landscape (3-5 paragraphs).

If Zotero BibTeX was exported, include a `references.bib` snippet for direct use in paper writing.

### Step 5: Save (if requested)
- Save paper PDFs to `literature/` or `papers/`
- Update related work notes in project memory
- If Obsidian is available, optionally create a literature review note in the vault

### Step 6: Update Research Wiki

If the project has an active research wiki, update it after producing the literature review:

1. Add or update the topic page with the final paper table, grouped themes, and open gaps.
2. Link each paper to its canonical source and local PDF path if available.
3. Record which sources were used: Zotero, Obsidian, local PDFs, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, DeepXiv, Exa, or broader web.
4. Mark unresolved search gaps and papers requiring follow-up reading.
5. Follow the wiki integration contract in [`shared-references/integration-contract.md`](../shared-references/integration-contract.md).
6. When the wiki helper is available, rebuild `query_pack.md` after updating literature entries so `/idea-creator` can reuse the latest gaps and failed directions.

If the wiki path or format is unclear, ask before writing. Do not invent a wiki location.

## Key Rules
- Always include paper citations (authors, year, venue)
- Distinguish between peer-reviewed and preprints
- Be honest about limitations of each paper
- Note if a paper directly competes with or supports our approach
- If a user-requested Zotero or Obsidian source is unavailable, stop and report the missing configuration instead of silently degrading.
- Only unrequested optional sources may be skipped automatically.
- Zotero/Obsidian tools may have different names depending on how the user configured the MCP server (e.g., `mcp__zotero__search` or `mcp__zotero-mcp__search_items`). Try the most common patterns and adapt.

## Consolidated ARIS Source Merge

This keeper is the active Codex-facing ARIS skill for this capability. Imported base and reviewer-overlay variants were read and folded into this keeper; source copies remain only for rollback/deep reference.

### Merged Sources
- `aris-research-lit`: 406 lines, sha `2813ed94c750dbaf`, source-overlap `0.45`. Trigger: Search and analyze research papers, find related work, summarize key ideas. Use when user says "find papers", "related work", "literature review", "what does this paper say", or needs to understand academic papers.

### Retained Operating Rules
- Treat search results as leads until metadata, source URL, and claim relevance are checked.
- Return query, filters, selected sources, rejected sources, and uncertainty rather than only a citation list.
- Source-specific retained points from `aris-research-lit`:
  - **REVIEWER_BACKEND = `codex`** — Default: Codex MCP (xhigh). Override with `— reviewer: oracle-pro` for GPT-5.4 Pro via Oracle MCP. See `shared-references/reviewer-routing.md`.
  - 3. Custom path specified by user in `CLAUDE.md` under `## Paper Library`
  - > - `/research-lit "topic" — sources: web, semantic-scholar` — also search Semantic Scholar for published venue papers (IEEE, ACM, etc.)
  - This skill checks multiple sources **in priority order**. All are optional — if a source is not configured or not requested, skip it silently.

### Merge Discipline
- Do not reactivate the imported ARIS/base/reviewer variant as a separate skill for ordinary use.
- If a source-specific retained point is stronger than the keeper text, apply that point directly in the task output.
- If a reviewer-overlay source names Claude or Gemini backends, treat that as an explicit alternate reviewer route only when the user asks for that backend or the local environment exposes it; default Codex work should not auto-open external reviewers.
- If the task touches external services, notifications, paid compute, or credentials, state the boundary and obtain authorization when required.
