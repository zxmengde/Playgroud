## Rules

- `related_papers` and `linked_knowledge` should prefer project-relative note paths.
- `paper_relationships` should record explicit semantic edges only when they are stable enough to support graph construction.
- `concepts` and `methods` may remain plain strings; do not create dedicated notes by default.
- Keep `Direct relevance to repo` concrete and actionable.
- Prefer one durable canonical note per paper; update in place instead of making sibling notes.
- If the user asked for a full collection pass, normalize the schema across the entire covered set before closing the task.
- Treat Zotero `webpage` items as acceptable inputs when attachment text or fulltext is still available and useful.
