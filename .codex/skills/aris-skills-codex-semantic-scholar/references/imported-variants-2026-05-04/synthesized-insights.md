# Synthesized Imported Variant Insights

This file is synthesized from full reads of disabled overlapping skills. Treat these notes as active guidance for the keeper skill, not as an archive. Read the source folders only when this synthesis is insufficient.

Keeper: aris-skills-codex-semantic-scholar

## How To Apply

- Prefer the keeper skill workflow as the default path.
- Add the trigger phrases, verification checks, output contracts, and resource pointers below when they fit the task.
- If a disabled variant contains scripts, templates, references, examples, or assets, treat them as reusable resources from this keeper skill.
- Do not resurrect a disabled variant as a separate active skill unless the keeper cannot express its behavior cleanly.

## Source: aris-semantic-scholar

Trigger/description delta: Search published venue papers (IEEE, ACM, Springer, etc.) via Semantic Scholar API. Complements /arxiv (preprints) with citation counts, venue metadata, and TLDR. Use when user says "search semantic scholar", "find IEEE papers", "find journal papers", "venue papers", "citation search", or wants published literature beyond arXiv preprints.
Actionable imported checks:
- **`- type: journal|conference|review|all`**: map to `--publication-types`
- If present → paper is also on arXiv. Note this in output but do NOT re-fetch via `/arxiv`.
- **openAccessPdf may be empty**: Many IEEE papers are closed access. Always provide the DOI link as fallback.
- If the S2 API is unreachable, suggest using `/arxiv` or `/research-lit "topic" - sources: web` as fallback.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Parse Arguments
Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for directives:
- **Query or ID**: main search term, or a paper identifier:
  - DOI: `10.1109/TWC.2024.1234567`
  - Semantic Scholar ID: `f9314fd99be5f2b1b3efcfab87197d578160d553`
  - ArXiv: `ARXIV:2006.10685`
  - Corpus: `CorpusId:219792180`
- **`- max: N`**: override MAX_RESULTS
- **`- type: journal|conference|review|all`**: map to `--publication-types`
- **`- min-citations: N`**: map to `--min-citations`
- **`- year: RANGE`**: map to `--year` (e.g. `2022-`, `2020-2024`)
- **`- fields: FIELDS`**: override `--fields-of-study` (use `all` to remove filter)
- **`- sort: citations|date`**: use `search-bulk` with `--sort citationCount:desc` or `publicationDate:desc`
If the argument matches a DOI pattern (`10.XXXX/...`), a Semantic Scholar ID (40-char hex), or a prefixed ID (`ARXIV:...`, `CorpusId:...`), skip search and go directly to Step 3.
